# COMP 342 Labs

### Lab 1
Flag of Nepal

### Lab 2
1. Implement Digital Differential Analyzer Line drawing algorithm.
2. Implement Bresenham Line Drawing algorithm for both slopes(|m|<1 and |m|>=1).

### Lab 3
1. Write a Program to implement mid- point Circle Drawing Algorithm
2. Write a Program to implement mid- point Ellipse Drawing Algorithm

### Lab 4
1. Write a Program to implement:
a. 2D Translation
b. 2D Rotation
c. 2D Scaling
d. 2D Reflection
e. 2D Shearing
(For doing these Transformations consider any 2D shapes (Line, Triangle, Rectangle etc), and
use Homogeneous coordinate Systems)

### Lab 5
1. Implement Cohen Sutherland Line Clipping algorithm
2. Implement Sutherland Hodgemann polygon clipping algorithm
3. Write a Program to Implement:
a. 3D Translation
b. 3D Rotation
c. 3D Scaling
(Consider any three dimensional shapes given by your graphics and library and Perform these
Transformations)
